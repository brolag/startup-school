# Understanding Your Users

> The most successful startups are built by founders who deeply understand their users' needs, behaviors, and motivations.

## Why User Research Matters

Most startups fail not because they can't build a product, but because they build something people don't want. User research helps you:

- **Validate assumptions** before building
- **Discover hidden needs** users can't articulate
- **Prioritize features** that matter most
- **Reduce development waste** on unused features
- **Build empathy** for your target audience

## Types of Users to Research

### Primary Users
- Who directly uses your product
- Who experiences the main problem
- Who would pay for the solution

### Secondary Users
- Who influences the buying decision
- Who might be affected by the product
- Who could become advocates

### Edge Cases
- Power users with unique needs
- Users in different contexts
- Users with accessibility needs

## User Research Methods

### 1. User Interviews (Most Important)

**When**: Before building anything
**Goal**: Understand problems, not validate solutions
**Duration**: 30-45 minutes
**Sample Size**: 15-20 interviews for initial insights

**Interview Structure**:
1. **Background** (5 min): Understand their context
2. **Current State** (15 min): How they solve the problem today
3. **Pain Points** (15 min): What frustrates them most
4. **Ideal Future** (5 min): What would perfect look like
5. **Wrap-up** (5 min): Any questions, next steps

### 2. Observational Research

**Shadowing**: Watch users in their natural environment
**Diary Studies**: Users document their experiences
**Screen Recording**: Watch how users interact with existing tools

### 3. Surveys (For Quantification)

**When**: After you understand the problem qualitatively
**Goal**: Measure how widespread insights are
**Best Practice**: Keep it short (5-7 questions max)

### 4. Analytics & Behavior Data

**Existing Products**: How do users currently behave?
**Prototypes**: What do users actually do vs. say?
**A/B Tests**: Which approach works better?

## The Mom Test Framework

Based on Rob Fitzpatrick's book, avoid these bad questions:

❌ **Bad**: "Would you use this product?"
✅ **Good**: "How do you currently solve this problem?"

❌ **Bad**: "Do you think this is a good idea?"
✅ **Good**: "What's the hardest part about [current process]?"

❌ **Bad**: "Would you pay $X for this?"
✅ **Good**: "How much does this problem cost you currently?"

## Creating User Personas

Based on your research, create 2-3 detailed personas:

**Template**:
- **Name & Photo**: Make them feel real
- **Demographics**: Age, location, job, income
- **Goals**: What they're trying to achieve
- **Frustrations**: Current pain points
- **Behaviors**: How they work, shop, communicate
- **Quote**: Something they might say about the problem

## User Journey Mapping

Map out the user's experience:

1. **Awareness**: How do they discover they have a problem?
2. **Research**: How do they look for solutions?
3. **Evaluation**: How do they compare options?
4. **Purchase**: What's their buying process?
5. **Onboarding**: How do they get started?
6. **Usage**: What's their ongoing experience?
7. **Advocacy**: When do they recommend to others?

## Common Research Mistakes

1. **Leading Questions**: Guiding users to the answer you want
2. **Talking Too Much**: Not listening to what users actually say
3. **Only Talking to Friends**: Biased sample that agrees with you
4. **Asking About Future Behavior**: People can't predict what they'll do
5. **Ignoring Negative Feedback**: Only hearing what confirms your idea

## Research on a Budget

### Free Methods
- **Social Media**: Join communities where your users hang out
- **Reddit/Forums**: Read existing discussions about the problem
- **Coffee Chats**: Informal conversations with potential users
- **Online Communities**: Discord, Slack groups, Facebook groups

### Low-Cost Methods
- **User Interviews**: $25-50 gift cards for 30-minute calls
- **Online Surveys**: Free tools like Google Forms or Typeform
- **Landing Page Tests**: Build a simple page and measure interest

## Organizing Your Research

### Research Repository
Create a shared document with:
- **Interview Notes**: Organized by user and date
- **Key Insights**: Patterns across multiple users
- **Quotes**: Powerful user statements
- **Action Items**: What to build or test next

### Regular Reviews
- **Weekly**: Review new insights with your team
- **Monthly**: Update personas and journey maps
- **Quarterly**: Revisit core assumptions and hypotheses

## Action Items

1. **Define Your Target User**: Who are you building for?
2. **Plan 5 User Interviews**: Use our [interview script template](../../resources/templates/customer-interview-script.md)
3. **Create User Personas**: Based on your research
4. **Map the User Journey**: Understand their current experience
5. **Document Everything**: Build your research repository
