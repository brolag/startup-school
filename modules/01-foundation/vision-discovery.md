# Finding Your Vision

> Your vision is your North Star - it guides every decision and inspires others to join your journey.

## What is a Startup Vision?

A startup vision is more than just a business idea. It's:
- **Purpose-driven**: Why does your startup need to exist?
- **Future-focused**: What world are you trying to create?
- **Inspiring**: Does it motivate you and others to take action?
- **Clear**: Can you explain it in one sentence?

## The Vision Discovery Process

### 1. Start with Problems You Care About

**Exercise**: List 10 problems that genuinely frustrate you in your daily life.

For each problem, ask:
- How often do you encounter this?
- How many other people have this problem?
- What's the current solution (if any)?
- Why hasn't this been solved well?

### 2. Identify Your Unique Perspective

**Your Background**: What experiences, skills, or insights do you have that others don't?
**Your Passion**: What topics can you talk about for hours?
**Your Network**: What communities or industries do you understand deeply?

### 3. Vision Statement Framework

**Template**: "We believe that [target group] should be able to [desired outcome] without [current friction/problem]."

**Examples**:
- "We believe that small business owners should be able to accept payments without high fees and complex setup."
- "We believe that remote teams should be able to collaborate without feeling disconnected."

## Testing Your Vision

### The Clarity Test
Can you explain your vision in 30 seconds to:
- Your grandmother
- A 12-year-old
- Someone in a different industry

### The Passion Test
- Does talking about this energize you?
- Would you work on this for 10 years?
- Can you see yourself becoming an expert in this domain?

### The Market Test
- Do other people immediately understand the problem?
- Do they say "I need this" or "I know someone who needs this"?
- Is the market big enough to build a business?

## Common Vision Mistakes

1. **Too Broad**: "Making the world a better place"
2. **Too Narrow**: "A better CRM for dentists in Ohio"
3. **Solution-First**: Starting with how instead of why
4. **Following Trends**: Building what's hot instead of what you care about

## Vision Evolution

Your vision will evolve as you:
- Talk to more customers
- Learn about the market
- Discover new opportunities
- Gain more experience

**Key**: The core purpose should remain stable while the execution may change.

## Action Items

1. **Write Your Vision Statement**: Use the framework above
2. **Test It**: Share with 5 people and get feedback
3. **Research the Space**: Understand existing solutions and competitors
4. **Start Building**: Begin with the smallest possible experiment
