# MVP Development

> Build the smallest thing that teaches you the most about your users and validates your core hypothesis.

## What is an MVP?

A **Minimum Viable Product** is:
- The simplest version that delivers core value
- Built to test a specific hypothesis
- Designed to learn, not to impress
- Fast to build and iterate

**MVP ≠ Prototype**: An MVP is a real product that people can use and (potentially) pay for.

## MVP Types by Stage

### 1. Problem Validation MVPs

**Landing Page MVP**
- Single page explaining your solution
- Signup form to gauge interest
- Can build in 1-2 days
- Test: Do people want this?

**Concierge MVP**
- Manually deliver the service
- No automation or software
- Direct interaction with customers
- Test: Is the value proposition compelling?

**Wizard of Oz MVP**
- Appears automated but is manual behind the scenes
- Users think it's a full product
- You handle requests manually
- Test: Would people use this if it existed?

### 2. Solution Validation MVPs

**Feature MVP**
- One core feature that solves the main problem
- Built with minimal UI/UX
- Focus on functionality over design
- Test: Does this solution work?

**Single-Feature App**
- Mobile or web app with one primary function
- Simple onboarding and core workflow
- Basic analytics to track usage
- Test: How do people actually use this?

### 3. Business Model MVPs

**Pre-Order MVP**
- Sell before you build
- Take deposits or full payment
- Deliver within promised timeframe
- Test: Will people pay for this?

**Subscription MVP**
- Monthly/yearly pricing model
- Limited feature set
- Focus on retention metrics
- Test: Is this valuable enough for ongoing payment?

## MVP Planning Framework

### 1. Define Your Hypothesis

**Template**: "We believe that [user type] will [behavior] because [assumption]."

**Example**: "We believe that busy parents will pay $10/month for meal planning because they value time savings over money."

### 2. Identify Core Features

**Must-Have**: Features required to test your hypothesis
**Should-Have**: Features that would be nice but aren't essential
**Could-Have**: Features for future versions
**Won't-Have**: Features you explicitly exclude

### 3. Choose Success Metrics

**Leading Indicators**: Early signs of success
- Signup rate
- Engagement metrics
- User feedback quality

**Lagging Indicators**: Ultimate success measures
- Revenue
- Retention rate
- Referral rate

## Building Your MVP

### No-Code/Low-Code Options

**Website/Landing Page**:
- Webflow, Framer, Carrd
- WordPress with themes
- Notion + Super.so

**Mobile Apps**:
- Bubble, Adalo, Glide
- Native: React Native, Flutter
- Progressive Web Apps

**E-commerce**:
- Shopify, Gumroad, Stripe
- Etsy, Amazon for testing

**Automation**:
- Zapier, Make (Integromat)
- Airtable + automation
- Google Sheets + scripts

### Technical Considerations

**Keep It Simple**:
- Use existing tools when possible
- Don't build custom solutions yet
- Optimize for learning speed, not scale

**Data Collection**:
- Google Analytics for web traffic
- Mixpanel/Amplitude for user behavior
- Simple forms for feedback
- Direct user interviews

## Common MVP Mistakes

### 1. Building Too Much
- Adding features "just in case"
- Perfecting design before testing
- Building for scale before product-market fit

### 2. Building Too Little
- Making it so basic it's not useful
- Not delivering real value
- Skipping the core problem

### 3. Wrong Success Metrics
- Vanity metrics (downloads, signups)
- Lagging indicators only
- Not defining success upfront

### 4. Not Talking to Users
- Building in isolation
- Assuming you know what users want
- Not iterating based on feedback

## MVP Timeline

### Week 1: Planning
- Define hypothesis and metrics
- Choose MVP type and features
- Select tools and tech stack
- Plan user acquisition strategy

### Week 2-4: Building
- Build core functionality
- Set up analytics
- Create basic onboarding
- Test with friends/family

### Week 5-8: Testing
- Launch to small user group
- Collect quantitative data
- Conduct user interviews
- Iterate based on feedback

### Week 9-12: Learning
- Analyze results vs. hypothesis
- Decide on pivot or persevere
- Plan next iteration
- Prepare for scale or shutdown

## Post-MVP Questions

### Success Indicators
- Are people using the core feature?
- Are they coming back?
- Are they telling others about it?
- Would they pay for it?

### Failure Indicators
- Low usage despite awareness
- High churn rate
- No organic growth
- Lukewarm user feedback

### Next Steps
- **Persevere**: Add features, improve UX, scale
- **Pivot**: Change target user, problem, or solution
- **Pause**: Take a break and reassess
- **Stop**: Shut down and move to new idea

## Action Items

1. **Define Your Hypothesis**: What are you testing?
2. **Choose MVP Type**: Based on your stage and resources
3. **List Core Features**: Keep it minimal
4. **Set Success Metrics**: How will you measure success?
5. **Build and Launch**: Aim for 2-4 weeks maximum
6. **Collect Data**: Both quantitative and qualitative
7. **Make Decisions**: Pivot, persevere, or stop
