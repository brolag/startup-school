# Market Testing

> Before you scale, validate that there's real demand for your solution in the broader market.

## What is Market Testing?

Market testing goes beyond user interviews and MVP validation. It's about:
- Testing demand at scale
- Understanding market dynamics
- Validating pricing and positioning
- Identifying go-to-market channels
- Measuring willingness to pay

## Market Testing Methods

### 1. Landing Page Tests

**Goal**: Measure interest and conversion rates

**Setup**:
- Create compelling value proposition
- Add clear call-to-action (signup, pre-order)
- Drive traffic through ads or content
- Track conversion rates

**Success Metrics**:
- 2-5% conversion rate (varies by industry)
- Quality of email signups
- Organic sharing and referrals

### 2. Advertising Validation

**Google Ads**:
- Test different keywords
- Measure click-through rates
- Track cost per acquisition
- Validate search demand

**Facebook/Instagram Ads**:
- Test audience targeting
- Measure engagement rates
- Test different creative approaches
- Validate demographic assumptions

**Success Indicators**:
- Low cost per click (<$2 for most B2C)
- High click-through rates (>2%)
- Strong engagement on content

### 3. Pre-Sales Testing

**Crowdfunding**:
- Kickstarter, Indiegogo for products
- Test demand with real money
- Validate pricing tiers
- Build early community

**Pre-Orders**:
- Sell before you build
- Offer early-bird pricing
- Take deposits to gauge commitment

**Partnerships**:

- Measure conversion from partners
- Validate distribution channels

## Market Sizing Validation

### Top-Down Analysis
- Start with total addressable market (TAM)
- Narrow to serviceable addressable market (SAM)
- Estimate serviceable obtainable market (SOM)
- Validate assumptions with real data

### Bottom-Up Validation
- Count potential customers in your area
- Survey willingness to pay
- Estimate adoption rates
- Calculate revenue potential

### Competitive Analysis
- Identify direct and indirect competitors
- Analyze their pricing and positioning
- Study their customer reviews
- Identify market gaps

## Pricing Validation

### Price Sensitivity Testing

**Van Westendorp Model**:
Ask four key questions:
1. At what price would this be so expensive you wouldn't buy it?
2. At what price would this be so cheap you'd question the quality?
3. At what price would this be expensive but still worth buying?
4. At what price would this be a good value?

**A/B Testing**:
- Test different price points
- Measure conversion rates
- Calculate revenue per visitor
- Find optimal price point

### Value-Based Pricing
- Calculate customer's current cost of problem
- Estimate time/money saved by your solution
- Price at fraction of value delivered
- Test with real purchase behavior

## Geographic Testing

### Local Market Validation
- Start with your city or region
- Test with local businesses/consumers
- Measure word-of-mouth spread
- Validate cultural fit

### Expansion Testing
- Test in similar markets
- Validate messaging across regions
- Test different acquisition channels
- Measure replication success

## Timing and Seasonality

### Seasonal Testing
- Identify peak and low seasons
- Test demand during different periods
- Plan inventory and resources
- Adjust marketing strategies

### Market Readiness
- Is the market ready for your solution?
- Do people understand the problem?
- Are there enabling technologies?
- Is the timing right?

## Common Market Testing Mistakes
